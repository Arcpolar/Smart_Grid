The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive regression machine learning model
using Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data to forecast and predict customer energy
consumption. By leveraging load profile clusters, weather information, and bank holiday
schedules, the model aims to provide accurate and reliable energy consumption predictions for
London households.

Traditional electricity utilities are currently going through digitization with the smart grid. With
electrification rapidly happening in many industries (i.e., the automotive industry moving to
electric vehicles), demand and consumption have been pushed to a new record high. The
fundamental problem that must be solved is balancing generational and consumption
demand. Smart grids can provide a lot of demand and consumption data
sample points for the utility to analyze, estimate, and predict demand.

AMI, as a fundamental component of the smart grid, records and transmits the customer
consumption and demand as a load profile back to utilities. These load profile data were used
for billing only at the beginning stage of the smart meter. After that, more power quality data
(voltage, current, and harmonic) was measured and returned to the AMI system. Predictive
regression machine learning models can be created to utilize these load profile data and provide
load forecasts and predictions. These load forecasts and load predictions are critical information
to control the grid and balance the load to minimize the brownout.
